Welcome! This repository was created with the purpose of showcasing different test automation tools I have either worked with or studied, and use them to test a single web app, as similarly as possible.

The tools are located in subprojects named by their programming languages. Each subproject has its own `README.md` file with more details and instructions to run in your own machine.

- [JavaScript (cypress)](./javascript/README.md)
- [Python (selenium)](./python/README.md)

The subprojects are a reflection of each other, which means they will have the exact same test cases written using different frameworks, which can be great for both learners or people looking for a quick way to compare the syntax of different tools! I explain some of the work below. Head to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for general information.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! :)
