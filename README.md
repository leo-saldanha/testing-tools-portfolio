<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify">

Welcome! This repository was created to showcase different test automation tools I have either worked with or studied, and use them to test a single web application, as similarly as possible.

The tools are located in folders named by their programming languages and for simplicity, I will call them subprojects. 

Each subproject is a reflection of each other, which means they will have the exact same test cases written using different frameworks, which can be great for both learners and those looking for a quick way to compare the syntax of different tools! I explain the work in detail in the next sections.

Head to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) at the top for more detailed information.
